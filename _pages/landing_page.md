The Quayle Lab is a cancer bioinformatics group led by Dr. Lewis Quayle, a Senior Lecturer in Data Science and Analytics at Sheffield Hallam University. With an interdisciplinary background in cancer biology, bioinformatics, and data science, Dr. Quayle and his team employ advanced computational methods to explore large-scale cancer datasets, aiming to derive novel insights into cancer biology and treatment.

Dr. Quayle's journey began with a PhD focusing on the development of innovative models of cancer quiescence, which has since evolved into a commitment to precision medicine and high-impact cancer research. The Quayle Lab specialises in integrating high-performance computing, next-generation sequencing data analytics, and machine learning to address clinically unmet needs in cancer research. Notably, Dr. Quayle has contributed to prominent projects such as the 100,000 Genomes Project and GUSTO clinical trials, exemplifying the labâ€™s dedication to cutting-edge research.

Our lab is embedded in both the academic and clinical research communities, contributing to collaborations, publications, and the development of bioinformatic tools to advance cancer biology. The Quayle Lab is also committed to open science, sharing our insights, resources, and analytical workflows to foster collaboration and support the broader bioinformatics and cancer research fields.
