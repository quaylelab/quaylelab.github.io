### **Senior Lecturer in Data Science & Analytics | Cancer Bioinformatician**

### **Overview**
Dr. Lewis Quayle is an accomplished cancer biologist, bioinformatician and data scientist with a strong background in computational biology and healthcare data analytics. Currently, he serves as a Senior Lecturer in Data Science and Analytics at Sheffield Hallam University and holds an honorary position as a Senior Lecturer in Bioinformatics at the University of Sheffield. Dr. Quayle has made significant contributions to cancer research, combining large-scale data analytics, machine learning, and bioinformatics methods to advance our understanding of cancer biology.

### **Education & Early Career**
Dr. Quayle obtained his PhD from the University of Sheffield in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Ingunn Holen and Prof. Penelope Ottewell. His PhD research focused on developing novel models of mitotic quiescence in human breast cancer cells *in vitro* and metastatic dormancy *in vivo*. Following this, his early postdoctoral work involved characterising the cellular sub-populations isolated from these models using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics, setting the foundation for his transition into computational biology.

### **Research Experience & Achievements**
In 2019, Dr. Quayle undertook a three-month training placement in high-performance computing (HPC) and RNA sequencing data analysis at the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics in Sydney, Australia. This experience further cemented his expertise in large-scale data analysis and bioinformatics. Upon returning to the UK, he transitioned to a full-time cancer bioinformatician role at the University of Sheffield's Bioinformatics Core Facility, where he contributed to various clinical projects involving next-generation sequencing and clinical data analysis.

In May 2023, Dr. Quayle was appointed Senior Lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, where he continues to blend his biological, bioinformatics and data science expertise to advance cancer research. Dr Quayle has contributed to various high-impact articles and has presented his work at national and international conferences, including the prestigious San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.

### **Research Focus & Projects**
Dr. Quayle’s current research spans multiple cancer types, focussing on leveraging **high-throughput multi-omic technologies**, **machine learning**, and **bioinformatic data analytics** to address unmet clinical needs in cancer. His notable projects include:

- **Metastatic Dormancy**: Identifying molecular drivers of metastatic dormancy in breast cancer.
- **Mutational Profiling**: Leading projects to create mutational maps for the 100,000 Genomes Project, specifically focusing on bladder and ovarian cancer cohorts.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Developing models to predict therapy responses in gestational trophoblastic disease.
- **Bioinformatics Support**: Providing bioinformatics expertise for the <a href="https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR128103" target="_blank">**GUSTO phase II clinical trial**</a> and supporting various smaller projects in public healthcare data, text mining and sentiment analysis, and predictive modelling.

### **Professional Development & Contributions**
As a dedicated mentor and educator, Dr. Quayle has supervised several ERAMUS, BMedSci, and MRes student research projects, and has guided two PhD candidates to successful completions. He is actively involved in developing and leading workshops on programming, bioinformatics and data analytics, and has been recognised with an AdvanceHE fellowship for his commitment to professional development in learning and teaching.

Dr. Quayle also actively contributes to the broader research community, serving as an editorial board member for *Clinical and Experimental Metastasis* and regularly reviewing articles for several leading journals. He is passionate about fostering research excellence, having reviewed grant proposals for the Academy of Medical Sciences and organising conferences such as NorthernBUG11 at Sheffield Hallam University.

### **Engagement & Impact**
Dr. Quayle’s impact extends beyond academia into public engagement and outreach. He has collaborated with various organisations, including <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">**NHS Digital**</a>, <a href="https://www.againstbreastcancer.org.uk/" target="_blank">**Against Breast Cancer**</a> and <a href="https://www.westonpark.org.uk/" target="_blank">**Weston Park Cancer Charity**</a> using his bioinformatics expertise to support societal engagement and health outcomes. He has participated in public engagement talks, the MRC Festival of Science, and charity initiatives like fundraising for Weston Park Cancer Charity, emphasising his dedication to using science for broader societal impact.

### **Personal Interests**
Outside of his professional endeavors, Dr. Quayle enjoys spending time outdoors, cycling, climbing, hillwalking, or tending to his vegetable patch. He also enjoys expanding his programming and statistical skill set and reading, boardgaming with his friends, and spending time with his family.
