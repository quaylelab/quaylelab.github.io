### **Senior Lecturer in Data Science & Analytics | Cancer Bioinformatician**

### **Overview**
Dr. Lewis Quayle is a highly accomplished data scientist and cancer bioinformatician with a strong background in computational biology and healthcare data analytics. Currently, he serves as a **Senior Lecturer in Data Science and Analytics** at Sheffield Hallam University and holds an honorary position as a Senior Lecturer in Bioinformatics at the University of Sheffield. Dr. Quayle has made significant contributions to cancer research, combining large-scale data analytics, machine learning, and advanced bioinformatics techniques to advance our understanding of cancer biology.

### **Education & Early Career**
Dr. Quayle obtained his PhD from the University of Sheffield in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Ingunn Holen and Prof. Penelope Ottewell. His PhD research focused on developing novel models of mitotic quiescence in human breast cancer cells in vitro and metastatic dormancy in vivo. Following this, his early postdoctoral work involved characterizing the cellular sub-populations isolated from these models using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics, setting the foundation for his transition into computational biology.

### **Research Experience & Achievements**
In 2019, Dr. Quayle undertook a three-month training placement in high-performance computing (HPC) and RNA sequencing data analysis at the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics in Sydney, Australia. This experience further cemented his expertise in large-scale data analysis and bioinformatics. Upon returning to the UK, he transitioned to a full-time cancer bioinformatician role at the University of Sheffield's Bioinformatics Core Facility, where he contributed to numerous clinical projects involving next-generation sequencing and clinical data analysis.

In May 2023, Dr. Quayle was appointed Senior Lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, where he continues to blend his bioinformatics and data science expertise to advance cancer research. He has contributed to seven high-impact articles, four as the lead author, and has presented his work at national and international conferences, including the prestigious San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.

### **Research Focus & Projects**
Dr. Quayle’s current research spans multiple cancer types, focusing on leveraging **next-generation sequencing**, **machine learning**, and **data analytics** to address unmet clinical needs in cancer treatment. His notable projects include:
- **Mutational Profiling**: Leading projects to create mutational maps for the 100,000 Genomes Project, specifically focusing on bladder and ovarian cancer cohorts.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing models to predict therapy responses in gestational trophoblastic disease.
- **Metastatic Dormancy**: Identifying molecular drivers of metastatic dormancy in breast cancer.
- **Bioinformatics Support**: Providing bioinformatics expertise for the GUSTO phase II clinical trial and supporting various smaller projects in public healthcare data, text mining, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling.

### **Professional Development & Contributions**
As a dedicated mentor and educator, Dr. Quayle has supervised several ERAMUS, BMedSci, and MRes student research projects, guiding two PhD candidates to successful completions. He is actively involved in developing and leading workshops on programming, bioinformatics, and transcriptomics, and has been recognized with an AdvanceHE fellowship for his commitment to professional development in learning and teaching.

Dr. Quayle also actively contributes to the broader research community, serving as an editorial board member for *Clinical and Experimental Metastasis* and reviewing articles for several leading journals. He is passionate about fostering research excellence, having reviewed grant proposals for the Academy of Medical Sciences and organizing conferences such as the NorthernBUG11 at Sheffield Hallam University.

### **Engagement & Impact**
Dr. Quayle’s impact extends beyond academia into public engagement and outreach. He has collaborated with various organizations, including **Action Bladder Cancer UK** and **NHS Digital**, using his bioinformatics expertise to support societal engagement and health outcomes. He has participated in public engagement talks, the MRC Festival of Science, and charity initiatives like fundraising for Weston Park Cancer Charity, emphasizing his dedication to using science for broader societal impact.

### **Personal Interests**
Outside of his professional endeavors, Dr. Quayle enjoys spending time outdoors, hiking, and exploring nature. He is an advocate for open science and strives to contribute to a collaborative and innovative research culture.
